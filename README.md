# Phishing Feature Extractor

Python pipeline to extract phishing-related features (general, host-based,
content-based and additional comparative features) from analysis JSON files
and build a CSV dataset ready for machine learning model training.

---

## Repository Structure

- `orchestrator.py` : main script that iterates over `benign` and `malicious`
  directories, calls each feature extractor and builds the final DataFrame.
- `extract_general_features.py` : extraction of URL-level, lexical and
  HTTP/DNS status features.
- `extract_hostinfo_features.py` : extraction of host-related features
  (DNS, SSL, ASN, geolocation).
- `extract_contentinfo_features.py` : extraction of content-related features
  (HTML structure, screenshots, headers, network activity).
- `extract_additional_features.py` : comparative analysis between `rd`
  (root domain) and `sd` (subdomain), including Wayback history and hosting
  inconsistencies.
- `output/` : generated directory containing `phishing_dataset.csv`.
---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (recommanded)  
- `pip` (or use a virtual environment)  

---

## Installation (recommended: virtualenv)

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux / macOS (bash)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Minimal `requirements.txt` example:**
```
pandas
tqdm
numpy
```
---

## Configuration Before Execution

Open `orchestrator.py` and update the global variables at the top of the file to point to the directories containing your phishing analysis JSON files:

```python
BENIGN_PATH = r"D:\Downloads\benign"       # path to benign JSON files
MALICIOUS_PATH = r"D:\Downloads\malicious" # path to malicious JSON files
```

Make sure these directories exist and contain `.json` files.

---

## Expected JSON Format

- Minified JSON files (single-line JSON) are fully supported by `json.load()`.  
- Each file should be a valid JSON object and ideally contain the following top-level keys:

```json
{
  "url": "...",
  "host_info": {...},
  "content_info": {...},
  "additional": {...}
}
```
- The pipeline includes defensive checks for missing or malformed fields, but heavily corrupted JSON files may still cause parsing errors.  

---

## Execution

From the root of the project (with the virtual environment activated):

```bash
python orchestrator.py
```

The script produces:
- `output/phishing_dataset.csv` — final CSV dataset containing all extracted features.
- A preview of the generated DataFrame is printed to the console (configurable in `orchestrator.py`).

## Host Information Features
### File: extract_hostinfo_features.py
========================================================

This module extracts features related to the hosting infrastructure,
DNS configuration, SSL certificate, and network-level properties of a website.
These features are crucial for phishing detection, as malicious websites
often rely on weak, incomplete, or suspicious hosting setups.

The extracted features are derived from the "host_info" section of the
phishing analysis JSON files.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. DNS Record Features
--------------------------------------------------------

These features describe the presence, quantity, and correctness of DNS records.

--------------------------------------------------------
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------

Content-based features capture how a webpage behaves, what it loads,
and how it is structured. Phishing pages often exhibit abnormal HTML
patterns, excessive scripting, suspicious URLs, and unusual network
activity. These features provide strong complementary signals to
URL-based and host-based analysis for accurate phishing detection.

Summary
--------------------------------------------------------

General and URL-level features provide a fast and effective first layer
for phishing detection. By capturing URL complexity, lexical anomalies,
suspicious keywords, and abnormal DNS or HTTP behavior, these features
enable early detection of malicious URLs before deeper content or
host-based analysis is performed.

========================================================
## Additional Comparative Features (Root Domain vs Subdomain)
### File: extract_additional_features.py
========================================================

This module extracts comparative and differential features between the
root domain (rd) and the subdomain (sd). Phishing attacks frequently rely
on malicious subdomains hosted on infrastructures that differ from the
legitimate root domain.

By comparing historical activity, hosting, SSL configuration, network
headers, and content properties between rd and sd, these features capture
strong legitimacy and impersonation signals.

The extracted features are derived from the "additional" section of the
phishing analysis JSON files.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. Wayback (Historical Activity) Features

| rd_has_screenshot   | Boolean  | 0, 1            | Indicates screenshot availability for root domain. |
| sd_has_screenshot   | Boolean  | 0, 1            | Indicates screenshot availability for subdomain. |

--------------------------------------------------------
5. Server and Network Header Comparison
--------------------------------------------------------

These features analyze server headers extracted from HAR data.

| Feature name        | Type     | Possible values | Utility |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| same_server_type    | Boolean  | 0, 1            | Indicates whether rd and sd share the same server technology. |
| rd_server_envoy     | Boolean  | 0, 1            | Indicates usage of Envoy proxy on root domain. |
| sd_server_envoy     | Boolean  | 0, 1            | Indicates usage of Envoy proxy on subdomain. |

--------------------------------------------------------
6. Derived Legitimacy Indicators
--------------------------------------------------------

These features combine multiple comparisons into high-level indicators.

| Feature name            | Type     | Possible values | Utility |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| same_asn_and_server     | Boolean  | 0, 1            | Indicates consistent hosting between rd and sd. |
| is_likely_legit         | Boolean  | 0, 1            | Flags cases where subdomain strongly resembles the legitimate root domain. |

--------------------------------------------------------
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------

Additional comparative features provide powerful signals for phishing
detection by highlighting inconsistencies between root domains and their
subdomains. Phishing campaigns often operate on newly created subdomains
with different hosting, SSL configuration, and no historical presence.
These features help distinguish legitimate subdomains from malicious
impersonations with high precision.
